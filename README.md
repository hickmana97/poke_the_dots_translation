# poke_the_dots_translation
Attempted translation of a Python project into Java

### **the program**

The program is a basic minigame where two dots of different sizes and velocities bounce around a screen, if the dots touch then the game is over. Score is measure in seconds until game over. Upon clicking the dot positions are randomised.

The program was initiall written using the Wing IDE for beginners and was written using an older version of Python, 3.7.9, thus was in order to be in line with the course material I was using at the time.

### **the goal**

The goal of this project is to translate my Python program into Java script using p5.js. I can then use this translation to make improvements and use what I learned in future projects.
